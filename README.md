# Atakan GÃ¼l - DevOps Engineer

## A Little Me
Hi it's Atakan. Let me tell you a bit about me. I'm a layz person :?, therefore automation is what I love the most. And I believe in the idea that if your system is not monitored it cannot be automated. I like learning new technologies, I keep follow various tech blogs and also myself writing blog posts on blog.atakangul.com Lastly I spend the whole day on computer so Cheers!
